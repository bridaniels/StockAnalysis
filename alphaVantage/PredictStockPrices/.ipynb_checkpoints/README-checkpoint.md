Deep Learning Framework: [Long Short-Term Memory (LTSM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory)
- artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture 
- feedback connections to process single data points, as well as sequences of data
- good for classifying, processing, and making predictions based on time-series data 
    - can 'memorize' patterns from historical sequences of data 
- commonly composed of a **cell**, **input gate**, **output gate**, and a **forget gate**
    - cell remembers values over arbitrary time intervals and the three gates regulate flow of information in and out of the cell
